# Operator in python

# 1 -> Arithmetic Operator
a, b = 10, 20
print("The value of a+b is : ", a + b)
print("The value of a-b is : ", a - b)
print("The value of a*b is : ", a * b)
print("The value of a/b is : ", a / b)
print("The value of a%b is : ", a % b)


# 2 -> Comparison Operator
print("\n\n Comparison Operator \n\n")
print("The value of a>b is : ", a > b)
print("The value of a<b is : ", a < b)
print("The value of a>=b is : ", a >= b)
print("The value of a=b is : ", a == b)
print("The value of a<=b is : ", a <= b)
print("The value of a!=b is : ", a != b)

# 3-> Assignment Operator(=,+=,-=,*=,/=)
x = 10
print("The value of x is : ",x)
x += 10
print("The value of x is : ",x)
x -= 10
print("The value of x is : ",x)
x *= 10
print("The value of x is : ",x)
x /= 10
print("The value of x is : ",x)

# Logical Operator
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)
print(a or b)
