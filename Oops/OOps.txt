Class -> Collection of data and methods 

                                                Class
                                            /          \
                                         Data           Function
                                        or Property     or Behaviour

Class name always be in PascalCase  -> ThisIsPascalCase
                                       thisIsCamelCase

Object -> These are the Instance of the Class
Ex

class Car -> Object (Wagnor, Swift, Innova, Celerio, Bolero)
class Sports -> Object(Cricket, Volleyball, Badminton, Football)
class Animal -> Object(Lion, Tiger, Monkey, Donkey, Dog, Cat, Ass)

Function Vs methods

Methods are special functions which are inside a class

Ex - lst = [1,2,3,4]

len(lst) -> This is function

while
lst.append(3) -> This is Method

Instance variable -> These are the variabel which are defined in the constructor and these have different value for each Object
