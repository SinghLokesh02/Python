DICTIONARY PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.

Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

2. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

3. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries.

4. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary (values must be integer).

5. Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum values of a dictionary (values must be integer).

6. Write a Python program to check if a dictionary is empty or not.

7. Write a Python program to get the top three items in a shop.
Sample data: {'item1': 45.50, 'item2':35, 'item3': 41.30, 'item4':55, 'item5': 24}
Expected Output:
item4 55
item1 45.5
item3 41.3

8. Write a Python program to get the key, value and item in a dictionary.

9. Write a Python program to match key values in two dictionaries.
Sample dictionary: {'key1': 1, 'key2': 3, 'key3': 2}, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}
Expected output: key1: 1 is present in both x and y

10. Write a Python program to sort a given dictionary by key.
